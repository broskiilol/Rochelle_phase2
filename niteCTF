> Geoguessr, but make it slightly more ragebait-y.
### Solution: 
- I see the utility pole nearby and i translate it
- "Park Jia" is the owner of the utility pole...which doesnt tell us anything
- The `N` tells us about the county. `0489` this means in the `N` rectangular area, the pole is 04% east and 89% north. this shows us the approx area of the pole (upper left area basically)

> Geoguessr, but make it slightly more ragebait-y
### Solution:
- The signboard nearby, i try to translate, it gives `Meiko` some garden which i put into google search, it is not any actual place.
- I can now see a electricity pole (like the previous challenge) so i try to look into that

- Something to know, different places in Japan have different ways of writing on the plate. It varies in the way of writing etc.

- The writing style in this case is similar to Kyushu style. The plate on it says `659`. The first digit corresponds to latitude (or we can just see the example in the following doc which corresponds to kumamoto. )

- Thus we have an approximate area where we need to be looking. So by trial and error we can get the correct area.
